GFG: Print all LCS sequences

You are given two strings s and t. Now your task is to print all longest common sub-sequences in lexicographical order.

Note -  A Sub-sequence is derived from another string by deleting some or none of the elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example 1:
Input: s = abaaa, t = baabaca
Output: aaaa abaa baaa
Explanation - Length of lcs is 4, in lexicographical order they are aaaa, abaa, baaa

Example 2:
Input: s = aaa, t = a
Output: a
Your Task:
You do not need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function all_longest_common_subsequences() which takes strings s and t as first and second parameters respectively and returns a list of strings which contains all possible longest common subsequences in lexicographical order.
 
Expected Time Complexity: O(n3)
Expected Space Complexity: O(k * n) where k is a constant less than n.
 
Constraints:
1 ≤ Length of both strings ≤ 50
