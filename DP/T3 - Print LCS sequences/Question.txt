Print LCS sequence

You are given two strings s and t. Now your task is to print any one of the longest common sub-sequences.

Note -  A Sub-sequence is derived from another string by deleting some or none of the elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example 1:
Input: s = abaaa, t = baabaca
Output: aaaa or abaa or baaa

Example 2:
Input: s = aaa, t = a
Output: a

Your Task:
You do not need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function which takes strings s and t as first and second parameters respectively and returns a string which contains longest common subsequence.
 
Constraints:
1 ≤ Length of both strings ≤ 50
