Transaction Simplification

Implement a prototype service to simplify a group of debt transactions.


There are n people, and a list of m debts amongst them where debts[i] = [from[i], to[i], amount[i]] represents that person from[i] owes the person to[i] an amount of amount[i].

Given the array debts, find the minimum number of transactions required to clear all the debts.

Sample Case 0

3
→n = 3

2
→size of debt m = 2

3
→size of debt[i] = 3

0 1 10

2 0 5

debts[] = [[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]]

Sample Output
2

Explanation
Person 2 must pay person 0 5 units, and person 0 must pay person 1 10 units.
